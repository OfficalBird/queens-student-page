**Summary (3 sentences):** My biggest win was successfully publishing my student page on GitHub Pages and seeing my personalized content live online. / One quick fix would be to double-check image sizing so the portrait displays neatly. / A nice-to-have in the future would be adding more styling or interactive features, such as buttons or animations, to make the page stand out.
